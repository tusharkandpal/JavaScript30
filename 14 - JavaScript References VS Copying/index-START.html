    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 50;
    // let age1 = age;
    // console.log(age, age1);
    // age = 40;
    // console.log(age, age1);

    // let name = "kush";
    // let name1 = name;
    // console.log(name, name1);
    // name = "tushar";
    // console.log(name, name1);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Kush';
    // Team is just a reference to original array i.e players.

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team1 = players.slice();
    
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players];
    // team3[3] = 'Tushar';
    // console.log(players, team3);

    const team4 = Array.from(players);
 
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 60;
    
    // console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap1 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 40, age: 20});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap2 = {...person};
    cap2.age = 10;

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const me = {
      name: 'kush',
      age: 130,
      social: {
        twitter: '@tushar_kandpal',
        fb: 'kush'
      }
    };

    // console.clear();
    console.log(me);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, me);
    // It works for only 1 level deep object content


    const dev1 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(me));
    // It works for all
